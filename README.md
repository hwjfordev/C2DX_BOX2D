C2DX_BOX2D
==========

The cocos2d-x modified chipmunk physics is complete and utter crap.  
Most notably, there isn't any continuous collision detection making  
tunneling of objects a pain in my ass to deal with. So, I've  
adopted the basterdized box2D PE and integrated it into my projects.  
Honestly though, you're better off rolling out your own custom specialized    
logic for collision detection since general physics engines are really,  
really slow and overkill. But I'm not gonna tell you what to do so everything  
here is "licensed" under the WTFPL unless it's taken from another author  
then just don't get caught if it's not cool.  
  
  
Without futher ado, the tutorials here are built using cocos2d-x v3.2 + box2D  
and MSVC2012 although I've purposefully left out the build files since YMMV.  
I must note that the box2D is aready packaged in the cocos2d-x external folder.  
If Version > 3.2 is released, I will update the guide to setting up Box2D  
there isn't major backwards incompatibility. Otherwise, I'll be leaving  
these in code rot hell. GET IT WHILE IT'S HOT!
